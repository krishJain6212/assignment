• What is a Bootstrap Container, and how does it work?

 --> Bootstrap Containers are the most basic layout element in Bootstrap. Bootstrap Containers are very essential and basic building blocks of bootstrap that wrap a page’s content. It’s responsible for setting and aligning content within it according to viewport or given device. Containers are defined within the container class (.container).


 1. Default-Container: The default container uses ‘.container’ class. It provides a responsive fixed-width container.

Syntax:

<div class="container">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>


2. Responsive-Container: Responsive containers are responsive in nature. Responsive containers allow you to specify a class that is wide until the specified breakpoint is reached, after which we apply max-widths for each of the higher breakpoints.

Syntax:

<div class="container-sm">Wide for small breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-md">Wide for medium breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-lg">Wide for large breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-xl">Wide for extra large breakpoint</div>
<div class="container-xxl">Wide for extra large breakpoint</div>


3. Fluid-Container: Fluid-container uses the ‘.container-fluid’ class. It is used for a full-width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport.

Syntax:

<div class="fluid-container">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
